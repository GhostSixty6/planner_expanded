# Planner Expanded

I use this browser extension to expand the Schedule view on Microsoft Planner.

This extension in combination with [Dark Reader](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?pli=1) makes for the perfect enviroment. 

Tested on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
